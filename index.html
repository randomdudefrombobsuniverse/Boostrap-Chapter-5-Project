            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Donald John Trump is an American politician,

                <br> to 2021. 
                <br> Trump received a BS in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968, <br>
                 and his father named him president of his real estate business in 1971

                Donald Trump served as the 45th president of the United States (2017–21). <br> He was the third president in U.S. <br> history to be impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and the only president to be impeached twice—once in 2019 <br> (he was acquitted by the U.S. Senate in 2020) and once in 2021. <br>
